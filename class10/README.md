## Comments on Lab 4 from Leila and myself (mostly Leila)

- We are missing Lab 4 for **Chris**, **Lydia** and **Miza**, a revision of Lab 4 from **Morgan** and **Akhil** (and one from **Sriram** to include the unadjusted results), as well as Lab 3 from **Lydia**.
    - Submit the Lab 4 work ASAP, like today. I have re-opened the Canvas links and they will stay open until 11:59 PM Sunday. Don't delay beyond that time, please. This is important to me.
- Leila built a table of some key elements from Lab 4, which I've modified slightly and shared on our Shared Drive as *What did Spring 2024 500 students do in Lab 4?* in the Lab 4 folder.
- Overall people are doing very well, and their interpretations and notes suggest they are much more comfortable at this point running these analyses
- Bonus items that were nice to see included imputation and double robust analyses
- The most common issue was regarding when to use a sensitivity analysis and what should be included in a stability analysis (hopefully our Class 9 discussion helped)
- Several people omitted sensitivity/stability altogether. Don't do that, especially with an analysis using propensity matching.
- Noted some issues with copying code from prior labs and examples, for example not changing the outcome model parameters and exponentiate argument for different outcome types.
