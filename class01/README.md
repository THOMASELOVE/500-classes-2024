## Learning about Quarto (and making the switch from R Markdown)

1. Virtually any code you have written in R Markdown can be run using Quarto instead, by simply switching the file extension from .Rmd to .qmd.
2. It's still worth it to learn about how Quarto works, and why it differs from R Markdown when it does.

Here are some suggestions:

- <https://quarto.org/> is the main website for all things Quarto, will help you get started making the transition, and has a detailed set of guides and references.
    - Here's the start of the [Tutorial, including Hello, Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) that shows you how to use Quarto with RStudio, which is what you'll be doing in this class.
    - This [FAQ for R Markdown users](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html) might be a good starting point.
    - Alison Hill wrote a great blog post [We don't talk about Quarto](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/) which got me started last April.
- [R for Data Science (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) has three chapters on [Communication](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communicate.html) which include sections dedicated to Quarto, Quarto formats and a Quarto workflow.
- YouTube videos discussing Quarto that may be of interest to you include (in no special order):
    - From Tom Mock at Posit (new name of RStudio the company)

        - [Beautiful Reports and Presentations with Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbf7Ai3jnxY) (1 hour 45 minutes)
        - [Create & Publish a Quarto Blog on Quarto Pub in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8qtcDyCRFA) (2 minutes).
