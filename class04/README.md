## Office Hours Change

## Examples using Quarto and R to do propensity analyses.

- The [toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy): Using R to do propensity score matching, subclassification, weighting and adjustment

We also have another worked example in R using Quarto, this one built by Wyatt P. Bensken and Harry Persaud, but based on real data. It's called [the lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) and we'll look it over in class briefly today after we complete the toy example.

## Discussion of Chapter 4 in Rosenbaum

We'll also attempt to discuss Chapter 4 (Adjustments for Measured Covariates) in *Causal Inference* today, in some small groups.

## OSIA Claims

I'll have some comments about the accepted papers in class soon. OSIA claims are found at <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-osia-2024>, and our first OSIA presentations will be on 2024-03-21.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/lab2.html) is due 2024-02-15 at 9 AM and will be your first good chance to practice what we'll see in the toy example today.
2. Read Chapter 5 of *Causal Inference* (Sensitivity to Unmeasured Covariates) before our next class, as well as skimming the Ahmed 2012 and Hirano and Imbens 2001 papers from [our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources).
3. [Project Proposal (draft 1)](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/proj500.html) is due **2024-02-20** at 9 AM.

# Self-Promotion

Tickets to some performances of [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are still available. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>. There are a few seats left for the evening shows on February 16 and 17, and reasonable availability on February 23 and 24. If you're coming to the show, hang around in the lobby afterwards for a few moments to meet the cast, if you like!
