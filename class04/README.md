## OSIA Claims

These were due on Tuesday 2024-02-06 at 9 AM, so I hope I have them all by now. I'll have some comments about the accepted papers in class today. OSIA claims are found at <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-osia-2024>, and our first OSIA presentations will be on 2024-03-21.

## Examples using Quarto and R to do propensity analyses.

- The [toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy): Using R to do propensity score matching, subclassification, weighting and adjustment

We also have another worked example in R using Quarto, this one built by Wyatt P. Bensken and Harry Persaud, but based on real data. It's called [the lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) and we'll look it over in class either today or next Thursday, depending on how much time the toy example takes.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/lab2.html) is due 2024-02-15 at 9 AM and will be your first good chance to practice what we'll see in the toy example today.
2. Read Chapter 5 of *Causal Inference* (Sensitivity to Unmeasured Covariates) before our next class, as well as skimming the Ahmed 2012 and Hirano and Imbens 2001 papers from [our Sources page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources).
3. [Project Proposal (draft 1)](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/proj500.html) is due 2024-02-20 at 9 AM.

# Self-Promotion

Tickets to [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are going very quickly.
