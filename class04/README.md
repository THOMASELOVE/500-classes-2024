The [toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy): Using R to do propensity score matching, subclassification, weighting and adjustment

## The [lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) is also ready for you to view/use

In addition to [the toy example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy), we have another worked example in R using Quarto, this one built by Wyatt P. Bensken and Harry Persaud, but based on real data. 

- It's called [the lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) and we'll look it over in class either today or next Thursday, briefly.
