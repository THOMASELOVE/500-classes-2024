## Some Notes on Lab 3 from Leila Hojat

- Most people are consistently doing very well!
- A couple of people are including outcomes in the propensity score - that's never something you can do, ever.
- One person had some very different results due to using the matched sample from the end of lab 2 to start lab 3 instead of the original canc3 dataset 
- Several students struggled with calculating Rubin's rule 2 from the `bal.table` results
- Several students went with the twang ATT weights, and those that provided rationales gave me the impression that they didn't have a good understanding of the effective sample sizes
- Other problems: forgetting to exponentiate and misinterpreting the results, calculating ATE instead of ATT, forgetting to use quasibinomial family
