## Self-Promotion

Tickets to [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are going very quickly. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>. The show runs February 2-24 on the weekends. It would give me great joy to see you there!
