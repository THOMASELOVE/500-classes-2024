## Announcements

1. **By class time**, I should have posted the Sketch for Lab 3 to our Shared Drive.
2. **By class time**, I anticipate having the complete schedule for OSIA presentations available at [the OSIA Claims page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-osia-2024/blob/main/README.md).
3. The [Right Heart Catheterization example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc) is now complete, including the sensitivity analysis material. We will discuss this a little today. 
    - The original paper is Connors Alfred F et al. 1996 [The Effectiveness of Right Heart Catheterization in the Initial Care of Critically Ill Patients](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2023/blob/main/sources/articles/Connors%20et%20al%201996%20JAMA%20The%20Right%20Heart%20Catheterization%20Study.pdf) from the *Journal of the American Medical Association*
4. We will discuss sensitivity analysis for matched samples as our main topic for today's class.
5. Our other topic for today is Rosenbaum *Causal Inference* and its brief Chapter 6 on anticipated counter-claims and quasi-experimental devices, but we may also want to revisit Chapter 5 on sensitivity analysis that we talked about on 2024-03-15, in light of today's discussion.
6. Remember that while we do have class next Thursday, we do not have class on the following Thursday 2024-03-14, due to Spring Break.

## Sensitivity Spreadsheet Information is in our Shared Drive

- The Excel sheet (developed in 2008) is available in our Shared Drive in the Sensitivity Spreadsheet folder.
- The PDF description of what the spreadsheet does (with examples) is also in our Shared Drive in the Sensitivity Spreadsheet folder.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Draft 2 of the Project Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/proj500.html#the-project-proposal), as well as the [Project Scheduling Form](https://bit.ly/500-project-schedule-2024) (now open) are due on **Tuesday 2024-03-05** by 9 AM.
2. [Lab 4] is due to Canvas by the start of class on 2024-03-21, which is also the first day when we'll be hearing OSIA presentations.
