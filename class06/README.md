## Announcements

1. Which OSIA talks will be presented in Classes 9-11, and which will be submitted as recordings?  See [the OSIA Claims page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-osia-2024/blob/main/README.md).
    - On our Shared Google Drive, I have also created a document called **OSIA Abstracts 2024**, which contains the abstract for each of our 22 papers, conveniently split into the 9 that will be presented in class, and the 13 that will be presented by video recording.
    - The **OSIA Abstracts** 2024 document also specifies which people will serve as second reader for the 9 to be given in class, and which will serve as second reader for the 13 that will be recorded.
    - I have added supplements for several articles to the PDFs available on our Claims page, too.
2. A list of Project Proposals (Draft 1) with titles is found [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2024/blob/main/project/proposal1.md). On our Shared Drive (by class time), you will find a more substantial Google Sheet called **Project Draft 1 Reactions from Dr. Love** including the following information, which I will try to discuss in class today.
    - Title, Research Question(s), Data Source(s)
    - Population of Interest, Outcome(s), Descriptions of the two Exposure Groups, Covariate Counts
    - Are the data in hand?
    - A question/comment or two (from TEL) in reaction to the draft
3. A reference I have been meaning to get to you is Frank Harrell et al's [Statistical Problems to Document and to Avoid: Checklist for Authors](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/author-checklist/3407).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Your next OSIA step is to review the abstracts and [register your top four preferences](https://bit.ly/500-2024-osia-reader2) (from within the "second reader" group I have assigned you) using the Google Form at <https://bit.ly/500-2024-osia-reader2>, by **9 AM on Wednesday 2024-02-28**.
2. [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/lab3.html) is due at class time next Thursday 2024-02-29.
3. [Draft 2 of the Project Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/proj500.html#the-project-proposal), as well as the [Project Scheduling Form](https://bit.ly/500-project-schedule-2024) (now open) are due on **Tuesday 2024-03-05** by 9 AM.
