## Announcements

1. We're back to in-person education at 9 AM today (Thursday 2024-02-15) in WRB 1217.
2. I posted a slightly revised sketch for Lab 1 to our Shared Drive after Aman was kind enough to let us know that I'd miscoded the sex. This affects the sex coefficients, but I think that's it.
3. The Lab 2 sketch will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**.
4. I think I now have everyone on my email list and on the Shared Drive. Let me know if I don't have you there.

## Finally...

[Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, is going well. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/> to reserve your tickets, but act quickly. There are a few seats left for the evening shows on February 23 and 24. All other performances are sold out. If you're coming to the show, hang around in the lobby afterwards for a few moments to meet the cast, if you like, although I know it's a long show.
