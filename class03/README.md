## Today's Agenda

1. Estimating the Propensity Score (Building the Propensity Model)
2. A schematic for propensity matching in a “simple” study
3. Mechanics of Propensity Matching
4. Schematics for other Propensity Methods in “simple” studies
5. An Introduction to The SUPPORT / Right Heart Catheterization Study
6. Lab 1 (How did it go?)
    - The Answer Sketch for Lab 1 is posted to our Shared Google Drive.

## What should I be working on?

1. Your [OSIA selection](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/osia.html) (due Tuesday 2024-02-06 at 9 AM)
2. [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/lab2.html), due 2024-02-15 at 9 AM to Canvas.
    - Here are the R packages I used to build my answer sketch for Lab 2, not counting the xfun package which I used only to present the session information.
        - broom, janitor, mosaic, naniar, tableone, and tidyverse.
3. Get started (if you haven't already) on your first draft of the [Project Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2024/proj500.html) (due 2-20)

## And, finally...

Tickets to [Curtains, the musical](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing), in which I play Christopher Belling, are going very quickly. The show opens tomorrow night. If you'd like to go, please visit <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>. The show runs February 2-3, 9-11, 16-18, 23-24 on Friday and Saturday evenings with two Sunday matinees (onr of which is already sold out.)
